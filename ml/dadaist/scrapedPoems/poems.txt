When they sold off the farm she took the childand caught a bus out of town—as for him,with everyone gone and everything grim,he opened a pint of bourbon, piledpictures, letters and clothes in the yard,doused them with kerosene, struck a matchand watched as they burnt to ashes, watchedand worked on his whiskey, working hard.The next morning he caught an outbound freightheading god-knows-where and he didn’t care—he was down to nothing, a gypsy’s fare—down to a rusty tin cup and a plate,dice and a bible, a bedroll and fate,down to a bone-jarring ride on a trainthrough country dying and desperate for rain,running nowhere to nowhere and running late.

As winter secrets  melt   with the purple  sun,   what is revealed  is electric —   notes tune  unknown scales,   syntax alters  tongues,   terracotta melts  white,   banyan ribbons  into armatures   as branch-roots  twist, meeting   soil in a circle.  Circuits   glazed  under cloth   carry  alphabets   for a calligrapher’s  nib   italicised  in invisible ink,   letters never  posted,   cartographer’s  map, uncharted —   as phrases fold  so do veils.
