% final:
% paper to sheaff
% paper to epayne
% pdf to epayne
% pdf to nuri
% must be bound, not stapled
% turn in draft w/ comments as well

%draft:
% 1 sided in color -> sheaff
% double sided in B&W -> payne
% electronic -> payne, nuri
% stapled is fine

% slideshow:
% number all slides
% make slides for questions you know will be asked
% get a laser pointer or something
% 1 slide per minute

% no passive voice
% 20p<= intro to appendices length <= 25p

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 4/10/2019
% break sentences up a bit
% roman numerals on tables -- done
% double check epayne notes
% instead of subsubsubsections: Basic sentence in bold with colon

% keep time keeper, make local storage just SD and also make it just the output
    % SD card itself will exist in breakdown but not details
        % quick justification

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 4/11/2019 - Stuff to do before submitting
% Have to edit Timekeeper to Epayne's edits, fix some technical errors, complete paragraphs, add some bits about software
% Finish Processing details section
% Make references correct, IEEE format - working on it
% Text in figures larger
% Proofread
% Make the Parts list text larger, by splliting into separate included documents - Dan has this
% Get rid of white space at bottom after paper is done
