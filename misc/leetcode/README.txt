A few exercises I've done online at the site leetcode, covering topics such as dynamic programming, memoization, backtracking, complexity analysis.
The comments and whatnot are lacking in some parts because I didn't anticipate uploading these for future reference.
If you try these solutions, though, you'll find they just about all compete pretty favorably with the average approach and that I put a fair bit of thought and consideration into optimizing each solution.

Above all, these are just here to show that I occasionally do useful things in my free time.
